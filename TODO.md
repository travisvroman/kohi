# Kohi Engine Roadmap

The items in this list are not in any particular order. This list will be updated occasionally as development progresses.

# Future Releases:

## 0.9.0 Release

- [ ] Rework khandle to use less memory (i.e. 32-bit globally-incrementing uniqueid instead of 64 bit)
- [ ] Extend kpool to optionally expand when full (if configured to do so)
- [ ] Simple Physics System (kphysics)
  - [x] Store triangle data in kgeometry.
        NOTE: This should be optional, and not done by default. A function could be added to (re)generate
        this and store it on the kgeometry.
  - [ ] Static bodies that don't move/react to collision.
    - [ ] Sphere
    - [ ] Rectangle (OBB)
    - [ ] Triangle-based mesh
  - [ ] Dynamic bodies that _do_ move/react to collision.
    - [ ] Sphere
    - [ ] Rectangle (OBB)
- [ ] Rework freelist to take alignment into account.
  - [ ] Rework renderbuffer to take alignment in during creation, and use said alignment for allocations.
  - [ ] Change Vulkan backend to use actual uniform size instead of stride when allocating from renderbuffer.
- [ ] Rework Vulkan shaders to only use compiled SPIR-V resources in the plugin runtime. This means that "shaderc" would not be
      required in the release build of the plugin. This also means that it _would_ need to be linked _somewhere_. Adding it to the
      utils plugin is one option, but having Vulkan-specific stuff there is strange. Could also make _another_ plugin that just contains
      the importer. This makes the most sense but has the drawback of being yet another plugin that has to be distributed (although, perhaps)
      it could be next to/a part of the vulkan renderer plugin somehow?
- [ ] Remove deprecated geometry functions in renderer.
- [ ] Remove calls to deprecated darray functions.
- [ ] Replace regular c arrays throughout the codebase with the new static-sized, type-safe array where it makes sense.
- [ ] Replace all instances of old darray usage with new one (NOTE: darray_create and darray_reserve)
- [ ] Replace all instances of typical C-style arrays and replace with new typed array from array.h
- [ ] Refactor handling of texture_map/texture resources in Vulkan renderer.
- [ ] Asset System
  - [ ] Jobify VFS asset loading
  - [ ] Asset type reworks:
    - [ ] Folders (Future)
      - [ ] Create/Destroy/Rename, etc., All happens on-disk.
      - [ ] Manifest Updates as items are moved in/out.
    - [x] Images
      - [ ] Importers
        - [ ] Importer for KTX (future)
        - [ ] Importer for PSD (future)
    - [ ] Static meshes
      - [ ] OBJ Imports - make material import/generation optional (so we don't overwrite the hand-rolled materials);
      - [ ] Create a "default static mesh" (named "StaticMesh_Default") which is a cube with perhaps a warning material.
    - [ ] Materials
      - [ ] Importer from MTL directly (as opposed to with an OBJ file).
    - [ ] Audio
      - [ ] Importers
        - [ ] .wav
        - [ ] .qoa (Quite OK Audio format)
- [ ] Asset Packaging
  - [ ] Manifest file generator (utility that looks at directory structure and auto-creates manifest.kson file from that)
  - [ ] Create binary blob format (.kpackage file) and read/write.
  - [ ] Point kpackage to .kpackage file for "release" builds.
- [ ] Resources
  - [ ] Materials
    - [ ] Importer from MTL directly (as opposed to with an OBJ file).
  - [ ] Heightmap Terrain (formerly just Terrain)
    - [ ] Refactor to encode a "material index" into an unused int/float within the vertex data, and eliminate the need to have "terrain vertex data" entirely.
    - [ ] Resource Handler - finish
- [ ] Handle refactoring
  - [ ] Create mesh system that uses handles (NOTE: maybe called "static_mesh_system"?)
  - [ ] Convert texture system to use handles (everything that _isn't_ the renderer should use handles).
  - [ ] Convert lighting system to use handles.
  - [ ] Create skybox system that uses handles.
  - [ ] Create scene system that uses handles.
- [ ] Audio
  - [ ] Audio velocity
  - [ ] Effects
    - [ ] Reverb
    - [ ] Low- and Hi-pass filtering
    - [ ] Ability to apply effects to categories or to channels directly.
    - [ ] Sound Volumes (namely, echo for caves/tunnels, with properties to adjust in scene config)
- [ ] Material system
  - [ ] Add a default "warning" material that stands out, to use in place of a non-existent material.
  - [ ] Blended materials
  - [ ] Material hot-reloading
  - [ ] Shading models:
    - [ ] Phong
    - [ ] Unlit
    - [ ] Custom (requires shader asset name OR eventually one generated by shader graph)
  - [ ] Two-sided support
  - [ ] Additional texture channels:
    - [ ] Specular (scale specularity on non-metallic surfaces (0-1, default 0.5)) (PBR, Phong)
- [ ] Break out kresource_static_mesh to be a single geometry with a single material.
  - Import process should ask about combining meshes. If so, all objects in an OBJ/GLTF/etc. would be imported as a
    single kresource_static_mesh. Materials would be combined into a single layered material. NOTE: This would probably
    require a limitation somewhere on the number of materials a "imported scene" can have.
- [ ] Rework hashtable to better handle collisions.
- [ ] Custom cursor
  - [ ] Hardware cursor (i.e. from the windowing system)
  - [ ] Software cursor (i.e. a texture drawn at cursor pos)
  - [ ] Option to set cursor image (and change on the fly)
- [ ] BUG: Hierarchy graph destroy does not release xforms. Should optionally do so.
- [ ] BUG: water plane - Fix frustum culling for reflections.
- [ ] Flag for toggling debug items on/off in scene.
- [ ] Flag for toggling grid on/off in scene.
- [ ] Profiling and performance pass - a few quick things to consider:
  - [ ] Optional ability to set texture filtering to aniso, and level, or disable.
  - [ ] Reduce draw calls
  - [ ] Occlusion queries/blocking volumes
- [ ] Combine duplicated platform code (such as device_pixel_ratio and callback assignments) to a general platform.c file.
- [ ] billboards
- [ ] particles

- [?] Move descriptor pools to be global to the backend instead of one per shader.
- [ ] Remove deprecated darray functions.
- [ ] Material redux:
  - [ ] Additional texture channels:

    - [ ] Convert nodes->Actors.
    - [ ] Convert attachments->ActorComponents.
  - [ ] Extensibility for user-defined resource types.
    - [ ] Handler?
- [ ] Actor-ActorComponent-ActorComponentSystem

  - [ ] Actor: Represents the base of something that can exist or be spawned into the world. It is similar in
        concept to the current scene "node".

    - Contains properties:
      - u64 actor_id: A unique generated identifier of an actor upon creation.
      - kname: The name of the actor.
      - khandle hierarchy_handle: Holds handle to hierarchy id if used with a hierarchy graph (which scenes do)
      - khandle xform_handle: NOTE: Not sure if this is really needed since it can be retrieved using the hierarchy_handle,
        but it might be useful for anyone using actors without hierarchy.
    - NOTE: For actors _not_ using hierarchy, the hierarchy would need to be managed some other way.
    - Can have any number of kactor_comps attached to it (see ActorComponent)
      - Each ActorComponentSystem will be responsible for maintaining this relationship (i.e. the system maintains a
        list of components to actor_ids). Better for memory, but might make it tricky to obtain a list of all actor types
        associated with a given actor.

  - [ ] ActorComponent: Used to control an actor (i.e. how it's rendered, moved, etc.). An actor can hold many of these.
  - [ ] ActorComponentSystem: Used to manage actors of a given type.
  - [ ] Types:
    - [ ] kactor_comp_static_mesh
      - Holds a copy of a static_mesh_instance
        - Contains a pointer to the backing mesh resource, which has an array of submeshes with geometries.
        - Contains array of obtained kresource_material_instances (matches resource submesh array, including duplicates for flexibiliy)
      - system used to generate static_mesh_render_data, which contains:
        - IBL probe index
        - mesh count
        - tint override (applies to all sub-meshes)
        - An array of static_mesh_submesh_render_data, each including:
          - vertex and index count
          - vertex and index buffer offsets
          - NOTE: size is known based on the type of render data
          - copy of kresource_material_instance
          - render data flags (i.e. invert winding for negative-scale meshes)
          - model matrix (per-sub-mesh for flexibility, in case an imported "scene" i.e. OBJ/GLTF has them)
    - [ ] kactor_comp_skybox
    - [ ] kactor_comp_water_plane
    - [ ] kactor_comp_heightmap_terrain
      - Holds pointer to kresource_heightmap_terrain
        - Contains array of geometries (3D_HEIGHTMAP_TERRAIN type, see above).
      - Holds kresource_material_instance of layered terrain material.
      - system used to generate kactor_comp_heightmap_terrain_render_data, which contains:
        - An array of heightmap_terrain_chunk_render_data (per terrain chunk), each containing:
          - vertex and index count
          - vertex and index buffer offsets
          - NOTE: size is known based on the type of render data
          - NOTE: material info is passed once at the per_group level as a layered material.
    - [ ] kactor_comp_directional_light
      - Holds a pointer to generated shadow map layered texture (NOTE: remove this from the forward render node)
      - Has a xform of its own, with the following caveats:
        - Scale does nothing.
        - Position is only used by the editor/debug displays to show a gizmo.
        - Rotation is used to derive light direction when obtaining render data.
      - system used to generate kactor_comp_directional_light_render_data, which contains:
        - vec4 light colour
        - vec4 light direction (derived from xform)
        - pointer to shadow map resource
        - NOTE: For debug views, this can be used to determine the rendering of a "line" or something indicating world direction and colour
    - [ ] kactor_comp_point_light
      - Holds a pointer to generated shadow map layered texture (NOTE: Not yet implemented, but this is where it will go)
      - Has a xform of its own, with the following caveats:
        - Scale does nothing.
        - Position is used for render data generation.

        - pointer to shadow map resource (NOTE: when implemented)
        - NOTE: For debug views, this can be used to determine the rendering of a "box" or something indicating world position, size and colour
    - [ ] kactor_comp_sound_effect
      - Holds pointer to sound effect resource
      - Holds position
    - [ ] kactor_music

- [ ] Per-scene vertex/index buffers
- [ ] Queue-up of data uploads during scene load:
  - Notes/ steps involved:
    - Setup a queue in the scene to hold pending mesh data.
    - For each mesh:
      - Make sure mesh is invalidated so it doesn't attempt to render.
      - Assign a unique id for it and add it to the queue
      - Load it from disk (multithreaded, currently done but needs some changes). Save off id, size, data, offsets, etc.
      - Reserve space in buffer freelist but _don't_ upload to GPU. Save the offset in the queue as well.
      - NOTE: that this could be used to figure out how large the buffer needs to be.
    - Repeat this for all meshes.
    - In one swoop, upload all vertex and index data to GPU at once, perhaps on a separate (transfer) queue to avoid frame drops.
      - Probably the easiest way is a single vkCmdCopyBuffer call with multiple regions (1 per object), to a STAGING buffer.
      - Once this completes, perform a copy from staging to the appropriate vertex/index buffer at the beginning of the next available frame.
    - After the above completes (may need to setup a fence), validate meshes all at once, enabling rendering.

  - [x] Rename plugin libs to consistent format, update builds, etc.
  - [x] Remove systems manager, and move all system init back to engine.
  - [x] External systems registry
  - [x] Plugin System implementation
    - [x] kruntime_plugin structure
    - [x] Convert Vulkan Plugin to kruntime_plugin

  - [x] Ability to deprecate code (mark as deprecated/warn).
  - [x] Deprecate "geometry" interface points in renderer frontend/
  - [x] Move loading of application lib from app to engine (config-powered!)
  - [x] frame/swapchain image count refactor:
    - [x] Move anything that's aware of double/triple/5x buffering exclusively to the renderer backend. Nothing outside that should know or care about it.
    - [x] Refactor renderer texture API to pass a new TEXTURE_FLAG_RENDERER_BUFFERING flag used to indicate to the backend that
          resources should be created "per-frame" if this is set (i.e. 3 internal textures for triple-buffering)
    - [x] Adjust render target logic to defer to the backend when reaching for a texture handle to use for the above case.
    - [x] Renderpasses should no longer own render targets.
    - [x] Framebuffers (i.e. render targets) should no longer require a renderpass to create. (i.e. use a dummy pass)
    - [x] Shaders (graphics pipelines) should no longer require a renderpass to create. (i.e. use a dummy pass)
- [x] 0.7 Scene refactor (see notes below):
- [x] Rename simple scene to just "scene" and move to engine core.
- [x] Create a unique-per-system handle for each system to identify a resource. These handles would be linked to
      a resource array of some sort and an index element within that array via a structure that holds both.
- [x] Create new "xform" structure and system that uses handles and can manage dependencies in updates internally.
      NOTE: This system should be laid out in a data-oriented way.
- [x] Create hierarchy graph that handles transform hierarchy and can provide a view of it. Also generating world matrices.
- [x] Remove transform from mesh.
- [x] Replace any and all transforms with xform handles.
- [x] Update systems (and create some) that use handles:
  - [x] Create xform system that uses handles
- [x] (See KSON) Refactor scene loader to a version 2 that is more expressive and allows "{}" syntax to nest objects.
- [x] Write "(de)serialization" routines for savable resources and use those in the above loader.
      Scene Refactor notes: Refactor into node-based system using handles for various types.
      A node should contain 3 (maybe 4) things: a unique identifier, a handle id (which is a
      link into a scene-wide handle table, which itself points to an index into an array of resources),
      a potential parent handle id (which can be INVALID*ID if unused), and potentially a name.
      There would then be lists of resource types (think mesh, terrain, lights, skybox, etc) which would
      each have lookup tables of handle ids to indices into these arrays. Additionally there would be a set
      of a lookup table and transforms that would be used. Separating these would allow updates on these objects
      in cache-coherent loops as well as any sorting/dependency lookup that would need to be done.
      The above will require that meshes have transforms removed from them. The transform would then be
      also referenced by the *node\* instead of the mesh. This would also facilitate batching of like meshes for
      rendering in the future. Transforms would also have the parent pointer removed, and instead also use
      handles. This would eliminate issues with invalid pointers when an array of a resource (i.e. transform) is
      expanded and realloced. This should be done in a phased approach, and thus perhaps a new "xform" should be
      created, and the "transform" structure could be deprecated. Note that the resource lookup for this would
      likely be global, not just within a scene.

        We could then have a few different "graphs" in the scene: one for transforms, one for visibility (i.e a flat
        array of currently-visible objects would likely suffice here), and others.

        We might also think about, at this point, reworking the scene parser to better handle object heirarchy in a more
        expressive language fasion (perhaps using some sort of scoping syntax like "{}" to surround objects).

- [x] Remove specialized rendergraphs. Replaced by app config.

  - [x] Sits on top of and manages packages, doles out requests to loaded packages, etc.
- [x] Remove geometry system

  - [x] Rename geometry->kgeometry
  - [x] Move creation of geometries to geometry.h/c
  - [x] Add geometry_type:
    - [x] 2D_STATIC - Used for 2d geometry that doesn't change
    - [x] 2D_DYNAMIC - Used for 2d geometry that changes often (NOTE: initially not supported)
    - [x] 3D_STATIC - Used for 3d geometry that doesn't change
    - [x] 3D_HEIGHTMAP_TERRAIN - Used for heightmap terrain-specific geometry that rarely (if ever) changes - includes material index/weight data
    - [x] 3D_SKINNED - Used for skinned 3d geometry that changes potentially every frame, and includes bone/weight data
    - [x] 3D_DYNAMIC - Used for 3d geometry that changes often (NOTE: initially not supported)
    - [x] CUSTOM - User-defined geometry type. Vertex/index size will only be looked at for this type.

- [x] New Resource System

  - [x] Remove old resource system after it is decomissioned.
  - [x] New replacement Resource System will not only replace old system but also all resource types within the engine to standardize resource handling.

- [x] Split asset loading logic from Resource System to new Asset System
  - [x] New asset system will work with asynchronous nature of VFS and automatically handle asset parsing/processing, hot-reloading and interaction with systems where necessary (i.e. texture system).
  - [x] Provide kasset structure which contains basic high-level metadata such as name, type, size and pointer to data, as well as a general "asset state" that can be looked at by any system (i.e. Uninitialized->Initialized->Loading->Loaded->Unloading)
  - [x] When an asset is requested, a name and callback are provided. The name and a asset-type-specific handler callback are provided to the VFS, which responds in kind when the asset is loaded. In the event more than one VFS call is required, the asset handler will be responsible for managing this and will ultimately invoke the original callback provided when the top-level asset was requested.
- [x] Asset packaging (kpackage)
  - [x] Reorganize assets from testbed.assets folder to go along with the respective "module".
  - [x] Rename all assets and asset references to use the format "<package>.<asset_type>.<name>". I.e. "Testbed.Texture.arch"
  - [x] Setup one manifest file including a list of all these files in each "module.". Exclude "source" files (i.e. .obj and .mtl).

- [x] Material system refactor
  - [x] Have material/texture system create the "combined" image at runtime instead of it being stored as a static asset (will make it easier to change in an editor without having to run a utility to do it).
  - [x] Convert material configs to KSON
- [x] Material redux:
  - [x] Shading models:
    - [x] PBR (default now)

  - [x] Add generic samplers usable everywhere (linear repeat, nearest repeat, linear border, linear clamp etc.)
    - [x] Add tracking to shader system as to whether these are used.
    - [x] Default sampler uniforms to use these.
    - [x] Add 16 sampler/texture limitation to shader system. (see required limits doc)
