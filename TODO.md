- [ ] advanced materials (WIP)
- [x] PBR Lighting model
- [ ] batch rendering (2d and 3d)
- [ ] instanced rendering
- [ ] Per-scene vertex/index buffers
- [ ] Queue-up of data uploads during scene load:
  - Notes/ steps involved: 
    - Setup a queue in the scene to hold pending mesh data.
    - For each mesh:
      - Make sure mesh is invalidated so it doesn't attempt to render. 
      - Assign a unique id for it and add it to the queue
      - Load it from disk (multithreaded, currently done but needs some changes). Save off id, size, data, offsets, etc.
      - Reserve space in buffer freelist but _don't_ upload to GPU. Save the offset in the queue as well.
      - NOTE: that this could be used to figure out how large the buffer needs to be.
    - Repeat this for all meshes.
    - In one swoop, upload all vertex and index data to GPU at once, perhaps on a separate (transfer) queue to avoid frame drops.
      - Probably the easiest way is a single vkCmdCopyBuffer call with multiple regions (1 per object), to a STAGING buffer.
      - Once this completes, perform a copy from staging to the appropriate vertex/index buffer at the beginning of the next available frame.
    - After the above completes (may need to setup a fence), validate meshes all at once, enabling rendering.

  * [x] panel
  * [ ] image box

- [ ] FBX model imports 

## Other items:
- [ ] Split off "core" items (defines, memory, strings, containers, etc.) into a "core" or "foundation" library so they may be used without having to pull in all of the engine.
- [ ] Split off platform layers into separate libraries outside the engine.
