# Kohi Engine Roadmap

The items in this list are not in any particular order. This list will be updated occasionally as development progresses.

# Future Releases:

## 0.11.0 Release

- [x] Remove rendergraph - have application drive render process directly.
- [ ] Rework hierarchy system to use typedefed u16s instead of khandles.
- [x] Rework Material system to replace khandles with typedefed u16s.
- [ ] Rework Shader system to replace khandles with typedefed u16s.
- [ ] Rework transform system:
  - [ ] Replace khandle representation with typedefed u16 and go by index.
- [ ] Move scene to game code, game-specific.
  - [ ] Change scenes to use single level of 'inheritance', i.e. have a base_entity that has props, then a static_mesh_entity that has `base_entity base` member.
  - [ ] Replace "node" config with "entity". Remove concept of attachments.
  - [ ] Remove all references to scenes in engine core/runtime.
- [ ] Refactor Testbed project for the above changes.
- [x] Remove viewports, enhance camera system to include this instead.
- [ ] Remove legacy systems (i.e. lighting, etc.)
- [ ] Hoist Overdrive project to it's own repo, refactor similar to Testbed.

## 0.12.0 Release

- [ ] Animation system/animated meshes.

## Future Releases

- [ ] Rework freelist to take alignment into account.
  - [ ] Rework renderbuffer to take alignment in during creation, and use said alignment for allocations.
  - [ ] Change Vulkan backend to use actual uniform size instead of stride when allocating from renderbuffer.
- [ ] Rework Vulkan shaders to only use compiled SPIR-V resources in the plugin runtime. This means that "shaderc" would not be
      required in the release build of the plugin. This also means that it _would_ need to be linked _somewhere_. Adding it to the
      utils plugin is one option, but having Vulkan-specific stuff there is strange. Could also make _another_ plugin that just contains
      the importer. This makes the most sense but has the drawback of being yet another plugin that has to be distributed (although, perhaps)
      it could be next to/a part of the vulkan renderer plugin somehow?
- [ ] Remove deprecated geometry functions in renderer.
- [ ] Remove calls to deprecated darray functions.
- [ ] Replace regular c arrays throughout the codebase with the new static-sized, type-safe array where it makes sense.
- [ ] Replace all instances of old darray usage with new one (NOTE: darray_create and darray_reserve)
- [ ] Replace all instances of typical C-style arrays and replace with new typed array from array.h
- [ ] Refactor handling of texture_map/texture resources in Vulkan renderer.
- [ ] Asset System

- [ ] Resources
  - [ ] Heightmap Terrain (formerly just Terrain)
    - [ ] Refactor to encode a "material index" into an unused int/float within the vertex data, and eliminate the need to have "terrain vertex data" entirely.

  - [ ] Audio velocity
  - [ ] Effects
    - [ ] Reverb
    - [ ] Low- and Hi-pass filtering

  - [ ] Additional texture channels:
    - [ ] Specular (scale specularity on non-metallic surfaces (0-1, default 0.5)) (PBR, Phong)
- [ ] Rework hashtable to better handle collisions.
- [ ] Custom cursor
  - [ ] Hardware cursor (i.e. from the windowing system)
  - [ ] Software cursor (i.e. a texture drawn at cursor pos)

- [ ] Per-scene vertex/index buffers
- [ ] Queue-up of data uploads during scene load:
  - Notes/ steps involved:
    - Setup a queue in the scene to hold pending mesh data.
    - For each mesh:
      - Make sure mesh is invalidated so it doesn't attempt to render.
      - Assign a unique id for it and add it to the queue
      - Load it from disk (multithreaded, currently done but needs some changes). Save off id, size, data, offsets, etc.
      - Reserve space in buffer freelist but _don't_ upload to GPU. Save the offset in the queue as well.
      - NOTE: that this could be used to figure out how large the buffer needs to be.
    - Repeat this for all meshes.
    - In one swoop, upload all vertex and index data to GPU at once, perhaps on a separate (transfer) queue to avoid frame drops.
      - Probably the easiest way is a single vkCmdCopyBuffer call with multiple regions (1 per object), to a STAGING buffer.
      - Once this completes, perform a copy from staging to the appropriate vertex/index buffer at the beginning of the next available frame.
    - After the above completes (may need to setup a fence), validate meshes all at once, enabling rendering.

  - [x] Deprecate "geometry" interface points in renderer frontend/
  - [x] Move loading of application lib from app to engine (config-powered!)
  - [x] frame/swapchain image count refactor:
    - [x] Move anything that's aware of double/triple/5x buffering exclusively to the renderer backend. Nothing outside that should know or care about it.
    - [x] Refactor renderer texture API to pass a new TEXTURE_FLAG_RENDERER_BUFFERING flag used to indicate to the backend that
          resources should be created "per-frame" if this is set (i.e. 3 internal textures for triple-buffering)
    - [x] Adjust render target logic to defer to the backend when reaching for a texture handle to use for the above case.
    - [x] Renderpasses should no longer own render targets.
    - [x] Framebuffers (i.e. render targets) should no longer require a renderpass to create. (i.e. use a dummy pass)
    - [x] Shaders (graphics pipelines) should no longer require a renderpass to create. (i.e. use a dummy pass)
- [x] 0.7 Scene refactor (see notes below):
- [x] Rename simple scene to just "scene" and move to engine core.
- [x] Create a unique-per-system handle for each system to identify a resource. These handles would be linked to
      a resource array of some sort and an index element within that array via a structure that holds both.
- [x] Create new "xform" structure and system that uses handles and can manage dependencies in updates internally.
      NOTE: This system should be laid out in a data-oriented way.
- [x] Create hierarchy graph that handles transform hierarchy and can provide a view of it. Also generating world matrices.
- [x] Remove transform from mesh.
- [x] Replace any and all transforms with xform handles.
- [x] Update systems (and create some) that use handles:
  - [x] Create xform system that uses handles
- [x] (See KSON) Refactor scene loader to a version 2 that is more expressive and allows "{}" syntax to nest objects.
- [x] Write "(de)serialization" routines for savable resources and use those in the above loader.
      Scene Refactor notes: Refactor into node-based system using handles for various types.
      A node should contain 3 (maybe 4) things: a unique identifier, a handle id (which is a
      link into a scene-wide handle table, which itself points to an index into an array of resources),
      a potential parent handle id (which can be INVALID*ID if unused), and potentially a name.
      There would then be lists of resource types (think mesh, terrain, lights, skybox, etc) which would
      each have lookup tables of handle ids to indices into these arrays. Additionally there would be a set
      of a lookup table and transforms that would be used. Separating these would allow updates on these objects
      in cache-coherent loops as well as any sorting/dependency lookup that would need to be done.
      The above will require that meshes have transforms removed from them. The transform would then be
      also referenced by the *node\* instead of the mesh. This would also facilitate batching of like meshes for
      rendering in the future. Transforms would also have the parent pointer removed, and instead also use
      handles. This would eliminate issues with invalid pointers when an array of a resource (i.e. transform) is
      expanded and realloced. This should be done in a phased approach, and thus perhaps a new "xform" should be
      created, and the "transform" structure could be deprecated. Note that the resource lookup for this would
      likely be global, not just within a scene.

        We could then have a few different "graphs" in the scene: one for transforms, one for visibility (i.e a flat
        array of currently-visible objects would likely suffice here), and others.

        We might also think about, at this point, reworking the scene parser to better handle object heirarchy in a more
        expressive language fasion (perhaps using some sort of scoping syntax like "{}" to surround objects).

- [x] Static-sized, stack-allocated, type-safe array with iterator.
  - [x] Tests
- [x] Dynamic-sized, type-safe darray with iterator.
  - [x] Tests
- [x] Vulkan backend:
  - [x] Support for separate image descriptors and sampler descriptors. Remove support for combined image sampler descriptors.
  - [x] Add generic samplers usable everywhere (linear repeat, nearest repeat, linear border, linear clamp etc.)
    - [x] Add tracking to shader system as to whether these are used.
    - [x] Default sampler uniforms to use these.
    - [x] Add 16 sampler/texture limitation to shader system. (see required limits doc)
  - [x] Change samplers to use khandles
  - [x] Bubble up sampler functions to renderer frontend.
  - [x] Remove concept of texture maps in favour of separate samplers and images
  - [x] Change shader system to set "texture" instead of "sampler".
  - [x] Change shader system to no longer hold string names for uniforms, but use knames instead.
- [x] Handle refactoring
  - [x] Convert shader system to use handles
  - [x] Convert material system to use handles
- [ ] Audio system
  - [x] kaudio system refactor.
  - [x] Audio "instances"
  - [x] Audio radius checks (think emitter vs lister pos./falloff)
  - [x] Audio instance play position + radius vs. listener + radius indicates if currently bound/playing on a channel.
  - [x] Auto-channel selection based on availability (gracefully handle out-of-channels i.e. discard oldest or simply don't play?)
    - [x] Channel reservation/sound types or "categories"
- [x] Debug shape
  - [x] debug_sphere3d (similar to the one generated for the editor gizmo)

## 0.10.0 Release

- [x] Refactor texture system to use ids only, typedefed as a ktexture.
- [x] Refactor asset system to use direct types, dispense with handlers/import logic from engine
  - [x] Jobify VFS loading.
  - [x] Rework import pipeline to exist in kohi.tools instead.
- [x] Remove resource system, directly use reworked asset system in dedicated systems.
- [x] Rework hot-reloading. (systems can register for a KASSET_HOT_RELOADED event and handle it thusly)
  - [x] Separate hot reload request call in VFS. This should return a watch id.
  - [x] Remove hot reload bool option in VFS request and in vfs_asset_data, as well as the file watch id.
  - [x] Fire VFS-specific event when a filesystem watch updates.
  - [x] Intercept above message in asset system, interpret how to handle it.
  - [x] Fire off asset-system specific hot reload event, accompanied by watch id.
