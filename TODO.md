  - [x] Move loading of application lib from app to engine (config-powered!)
  - [x] frame/swapchain image count refactor:
    - [x] Move anything that's aware of double/triple/5x buffering exclusively to the renderer backend. Nothing outside that should know or care about it.
    - [x] Refactor renderer texture API to pass a new TEXTURE_FLAG_RENDERER_BUFFERING flag used to indicate to the backend that
          resources should be created "per-frame" if this is set (i.e. 3 internal textures for triple-buffering)
    - [x] Adjust render target logic to defer to the backend when reaching for a texture handle to use for the above case.
    - [x] Renderpasses should no longer own render targets.
    - [x] Framebuffers (i.e. render targets) should no longer require a renderpass to create. (i.e. use a dummy pass)
    - [x] Shaders (graphics pipelines) should no longer require a renderpass to create. (i.e. use a dummy pass)
- [x] 0.7 Scene refactor (see notes below):
  - [x] Rename simple scene to just "scene" and move to engine core.
  - [x] Create a unique-per-system handle for each system to identify a resource. These handles would be linked to
        a resource array of some sort and an index element within that array via a structure that holds both.
  - [x] Create new "xform" structure and system that uses handles and can manage dependencies in updates internally.
        NOTE: This system should be laid out in a data-oriented way.
  - [x] Create hierarchy graph that handles transform hierarchy and can provide a view of it. Also generating world matrices.
  - [x] Remove transform from mesh.
  - [x] Replace any and all transforms with xform handles.
  - [x] Update systems (and create some) that use handles:
    - [x] Create xform system that uses handles
  - [x] (See KSON) Refactor scene loader to a version 2 that is more expressive and allows "{}" syntax to nest objects.
  - [x] Write "(de)serialization" routines for savable resources and use those in the above loader.
        Scene Refactor notes: Refactor into node-based system using handles for various types.
        A node should contain 3 (maybe 4) things: a unique identifier, a handle id (which is a
        link into a scene-wide handle table, which itself points to an index into an array of resources),
        a potential parent handle id (which can be INVALID*ID if unused), and potentially a name.
        There would then be lists of resource types (think mesh, terrain, lights, skybox, etc) which would
        each have lookup tables of handle ids to indices into these arrays. Additionally there would be a set
        of a lookup table and transforms that would be used. Separating these would allow updates on these objects
        in cache-coherent loops as well as any sorting/dependency lookup that would need to be done.
        The above will require that meshes have transforms removed from them. The transform would then be
        also referenced by the *node* instead of the mesh. This would also facilitate batching of like meshes for
        rendering in the future. Transforms would also have the parent pointer removed, and instead also use
        handles. This would eliminate issues with invalid pointers when an array of a resource (i.e. transform) is
        expanded and realloced. This should be done in a phased approach, and thus perhaps a new "xform" should be
        created, and the "transform" structure could be deprecated. Note that the resource lookup for this would
        likely be global, not just within a scene.

          We could then have a few different "graphs" in the scene: one for transforms, one for visibility (i.e a flat
          array of currently-visible objects would likely suffice here), and others.

          We might also think about, at this point, reworking the scene parser to better handle object heirarchy in a more
          expressive language fasion (perhaps using some sort of scoping syntax like "{}" to surround objects).
  - [x] Remove specialized rendergraphs. Replaced by app config.
  - [x] Separate debug shapes out to new debug_rendergraph_node.
  - [x] Separate editor gizmo out to new editor_gizmo_rendergraph_node.

- [ ] 0.8
  - [ ] Fix release build hang on startup (creating logical device).
  - [ ] Combine duplicated platform code (such as device_pixel_ratio and callback assignments) to a general platform.c file.
  - [ ] Split out MAX_SHADOW_CASCADE_COUNT to a global of some sort (kvar?);
  - [ ] Change rendergraph to gather required resources at the beginning of a frame (i.e. global.colourbuffer from current window's render target).
  - [ ] Separate colourbuffer to its own texture separate from the swapchain/blit to swapchain image just before present.
    - [ ] (Should probably be switchable for potential performance reasons i.e. mobile?)
  - [ ] Material system refactor
    - [ ] Support for multiple pipelines
      - [ ] Standard Pipeline (Forward rendergraph)
      - [ ] Custom Pipeline (Custom user rendergraph)
    - [ ] Shader config specifies pipeline it uses, which determines its attachments
    - [ ] Convert material configs to KSON
  - [ ] Handle refactoring
    - [ ] Create mesh system that uses handles (NOTE: maybe called "static_mesh_system"?)
    - [ ] Convert material system to use handles
    - [ ] Convert texture system to use handles (everything that _isn't_ the renderer should use handles).
    - [ ] Convert shader system to use handles (everything that _isn't_ the renderer should use handles).
    - [ ] Convert lighting system to use handles.
    - [ ] Create skybox system that uses handles.
    - [ ] Create scene system that uses handles.

## Renderer:

- [x] PBR Lighting model
- [ ] batch rendering (2d and 3d)
- [ ] instanced rendering
- [ ] Per-scene vertex/index buffers
- [ ] Queue-up of data uploads during scene load:
  - Notes/ steps involved:
    - Setup a queue in the scene to hold pending mesh data.
    - For each mesh:
      - Make sure mesh is invalidated so it doesn't attempt to render.
      - Assign a unique id for it and add it to the queue
      - Load it from disk (multithreaded, currently done but needs some changes). Save off id, size, data, offsets, etc.
      - Reserve space in buffer freelist but _don't_ upload to GPU. Save the offset in the queue as well.
      - NOTE: that this could be used to figure out how large the buffer needs to be.
    - Repeat this for all meshes.
    - In one swoop, upload all vertex and index data to GPU at once, perhaps on a separate (transfer) queue to avoid frame drops.
      - Probably the easiest way is a single vkCmdCopyBuffer call with multiple regions (1 per object), to a STAGING buffer.
      - Once this completes, perform a copy from staging to the appropriate vertex/index buffer at the beginning of the next available frame.
    - After the above completes (may need to setup a fence), validate meshes all at once, enabling rendering.
